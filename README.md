# Guess the word

This app is a simple "guess the word" game in which the code is purposely overengineered in order to provide a simple testbed for a TDD approach with async code, hooks, and context testing via Jest/Enzyme.

# Installation

To play the game, you'll need to install both the word server and the frontend.

## Installing the word server

First, clone the word server repo to your local machine:

`git clone https://github.com/flyrightsister/udemy-react-testing-projects`

then cd into the server directory and run the npm install command:

`cd udemy-react-testing-projects/random-word-server && npm install`

And run the app:

`npm start`

## Installing the front-end

Clone the frontend repo:

`git clone https://github.com/theborgh/guess-the-word-hooks.git`

then cd in the directory and npm install:

`cd guess-the-word-hooks && npm install`

Finally, start the frontend with:

`npm start`
